# Shift Handover Challenge Solution

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. Lack of Immutability
**Problem:** Original implementation used mutable data models
**Solution:** 
- Implemented `freezed` package for immutable models
- Created `HandoverNote` and `ShiftReport` with immutable properties
- Added methods that return new instances instead of modifying existing ones

### 2. Architectural Inconsistency
**Problem:** Monolithic architecture with tight coupling
**Solution:**
- Refactored project to follow Clean Architecture principles
- Separated concerns into layers:
  - Core (error handling, service locator)
  - Domain (entities, repository interfaces)
  - Data (datasources, repository implementations)
  - Presentation (bloc, screens, widgets)
- Implemented dependency injection using `get_it`

### 3. Error Handling Limitations
**Problem:** Minimal error handling and validation
**Solution:**
- Created custom exception hierarchy
- Implemented `ExceptionHandler`
- Added comprehensive input validation
- Introduced specific exception types (ValidationException)

### 4. State Management Challenges
**Problem:** Inefficient state management in BLoC
**Solution:**
- Improved BLoC implementation
- Added sorting functionality
- Enhanced error handling in state management
- Implemented more robust event handling

### 5. Note Deletion Functionality
**Problem:** Lack of ability to remove individual notes
**Solution:**
- Implemented `RemoveNote` event in ShiftHandoverBloc
- Added `removeNote` method in ShiftHandoverRepository
- Created dismissible `NoteCard` widget with delete functionality
- Validation added to prevent removing notes from submitted reports
- Ensured immutability by creating a new report without the deleted note

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Dismissible widget allows swipe-to-delete
- Repository method validates note removal
- BLoC handles state update after note deletion
- Error handling for invalid deletion attempts

## Additional Improvements

- Enhanced UI with more descriptive note cards
- Implemented flexible sorting mechanism
- Added unit tests for repository layer
- Improved note deletion user experience
- Improved overall code readability and maintainability

## Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests: Focused on repository validation
- Tested edge cases and error scenarios
- Validated note deletion functionality
- Mocked dependencies for isolated testing

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement more comprehensive integration tests
2. Add more detailed error messaging
3. Consider adding local persistence
4. Expand test coverage
5. Add undo functionality for note deletion

## Technologies and Packages Used
